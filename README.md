# Secret Decoder

This Python program, **Secret Decoder**, allows you to encode and decode messages using a simple substitution cipher. It provides a menu-driven interface for ease of use.

## Usage

To use this program, follow these simple steps:

1. Run the program.
2. Choose from the following options:
    - Enter `0` to quit the program.
    - Enter `1` to encode a message.
    - Enter `2` to decode a message.

### Encoding a Message

If you choose option `1`, you will be prompted to enter the text you want to encode. The program will then provide you with the encoded message.

### Decoding a Message

If you choose option `2`, you will be prompted to enter the code you want to decipher. The program will then provide you with the decoded message.

### Quitting the Program

To exit the program, choose option `0`.

## Cipher Key

The program uses a simple substitution cipher for encoding and decoding messages. Here's the cipher key:

- **Alphabet**: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- **Key**:      XPMGTDHLYONZBWEARKJUFSCIQV

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use this program:

1. Run the program.
2. Choose option `1` to encode a message.
3. Enter the text you want to encode (e.g., "HELLO").
4. The program will provide you with the encoded message (e.g., "XEHHD").

## Important Notes

- The program is case-insensitive, meaning it will treat uppercase and lowercase letters the same way.
- It only encodes/decodes letters present in the cipher key; other characters are ignored.
